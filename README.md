# BlackJack explanation

Blackjack is a casino banked game, meaning that players compete against the house rather than each other.
The objective is to get a hand total of closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21 (busting).
At the start of a Blackjack game, the players and the dealer receive two cards each.
The players' cards are normally dealt face up, while the dealer has one face down (called the hole card) and one face up.
The best possible Blackjack hand is an opening deal of an ace with any ten-point card.

When playing Blackjack the numeral cards 2 to 10 have their face values, Jacks, Queens and Kings are valued at 10, and Aces can have a value of either 1 or 11.
The Ace is always valued at 11 unless that would result in the hand going over 21, in which case it is valued as 1.
